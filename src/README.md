# Overview

This is a program that emulates blog posting and comment posting, as social media sites do. The user types in a username,
creates a password, and can type anything, which will be saved to a file. The user can sign back in using the same 
username and password, and also the user can display all comments made by a specific username. I created this program
to help me have a basic understanding of how Kotlin works, and to also prepare me to be able to make basic applications.

# Development Environment

I created this program using the Intellij IDEA IDE, which is a developer studio made by the same developers of JetBrain
IDE, but this one specializes in coding in Java and Kotlin, in which I used Kotlin to create this program. Kotlin is
interoperable with Java, and is primarily used for web and mobile application development. Libraries I used in creating
this program were all Java libraries, and were libraries that retrieved the current time and date and a library that
dealt with writing to external files and retrieving data from them.

# Future Work

- I would like to make the interface more appealing, and have an actually GUI, not just have everything be displayed
in the terminal.
- I would like to add the ability to post images, so that there's more to do than just make text comments.
- I would like to add the ability to comment on other posts, whether they be other comments or images.
